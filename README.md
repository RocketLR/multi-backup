# multi-backup
Two scripts that backup and monitor various types of configurations of Routers, switches and other devices.

# bak-tasks.sh
Perfoms the backup jobs. 

# bak-monitor.sh
Monitors that todays backupfiles are there. Needs to be run after bak-tasks.sh. 

# devices.json
This is where all the devices are predefined.

I wrote this specifically for my use case. 
Will try to update and improve so that it works for everyone generally.

So far it works on TrueNAS. Have not tested on anyother linux distros.
